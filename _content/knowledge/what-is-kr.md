The Knowledge and Reasoning components of the Watson Assistant power the personalized and proactive experience of your application.  As your users interact with the assistant through your application, the Expertise will create and maintain information about them and their world so that your assistant can proactively assist your users. Rules, created with the Reasoning APIs and SDK, can kick off services or engage your users when the information in their world changes or something you want to act on is created.

In the pages that follow, you'll go through a simulated tutorial to better understand how to create and change information in the Knowledge component as well as create a rule to engage your user.
